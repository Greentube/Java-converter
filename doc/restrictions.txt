 Restrictions
 ------------
 
 Basically the language features of java 8 are provided with the following restrictions
 (which will be checked by the converter at compile time):
 
 - Threads   
       No threading is supported at all. No synchronization keywords either.      
 - Exceptions
      No explicit exception handling. No throw and no try/catch. 
      Misbehavior of the program at runtime (NullPointerException,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,
      CastException,etc.)
      will lead to undefined results (the C#-target will probably behave quite similar to java,
      but javascript will often silently ignore the problem and run into trouble later on).
 - no 'long', 'short', 'float'
      These datatypes are either impossible to implement (javascript only supports a generic 
      Number type that can not hold a 64 bit quantity) or quite useless anyway (short, float).
      In some cases a java library method that returns a 'long' is supported. To use this 
      method, the java code needs to convert the result to a double immediately.  
 - Auto-boxing, Auto-unboxing not supported
      This feature would be a horror to get right in all conversion targets. Since its use
      is already quite disfavored in the first place, the converter does not allow it at all.
 - Method/constructor overloading only based on number of parameters
      Instead of implementing the java way of using the full type signatures
      of all parameters, the javascript target uses a simpler system that 
      takes only the number of parameters into account. As a consequence, it is not possible
      to have multiple identically named methods with the same number of parameters 
      and the same static/non-static state in the same class.         
 - No shadowing of fields and methods 
      No two instance fields in objects that are somehow inherited from each other can have the 
      same name - even if one or both are private. 
      Same holds for methods - but there the "name" is considered to be the 
      identifier in conjunction with the number-of-parameters.
      Static fields or methods do not have this restriction.
      Also local variables may shadow fields.
 - Compound assignments and increment/decrement operators must not have side-effects in the target 
      When using any of the operators +=,-=,*=,... it is only possible to use 
      a target that is guaranteed to have no side effects on evaluation. While 
      it is possible to use  a[i]+=5  it is unsupported to write  a[i++]+=4.
      Same thing holds for ++ and --  (i[4]++ is ok, i[get()]++  is not).  
      This is to avoid faulty double-evaluation behavior in all conversion targets. 
 - Access to static members is not allowed by using an instance expression with side-effects
      It is legal in java to call a static method with something like: 
      exp.valueOf(4711)    // where exp is of type Integer 
      Since the expression will just be eliminated during conversion, it must not
      have any possible side effects.
  - Different default implementation of hashCode()
      Objects not overriding hashCode will provide a default implementation may deliver
      an extremely weak hash (only depending on the object's class). Do not 
      use these as keys in any Hashtable/HashMap/HashSet. 
      The String and Double objects will create a good hash, but a different one as is specified 
      in java. Do not rely on certain hash values for specific strings.
 - Different default implementation of toString()
      Objects not overriding toString will provide a default implementation
      that is conversion target specific. Do only use to create a human readable debug output and
      do not rely on any specific format.   
 - Limited subset of java core classes
      The converter core itself provides a very limited subset of the java core classes and
      also a limited number of methods in each. 
      Mainly the most crucial parts of java.lang and java.util are provided and a
      minimal version of java.io.PrintStream to make 'System.out' and 'System.err' available 
      for simple output. 
      The whole java 8 Stream API is not provided, but similar functionality can be created
      using generics and lambda expressions. The Supplier, Function, Consumer, Predicate
      interfaces are provided to allow basic generic data transformation operations.
