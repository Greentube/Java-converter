Emulating 'long' values in javascript
-------------------------------------

Javascript has only a single numerical data type: Number. 
This can basically just hold a double precision floating point value (with optimizations done
by the javascript engine to allow faster operation in case of integral values).
 
As long as the values are not too big in magnitude (lower than -2^53 or higher than 2^53) 
a normal Number can be used. For values that would need too many digits, a specific
emulation object must be created:
Emulation of big 64 bit values is done with an immutable object that stores the 
two 32-bit halves of the value as individual numbers, each in the range of  0 to 2^32-1.
Here only positive numbers are used to represent the internal bit pattern, but if the
highest bit of the high value is '1', the whole long is considered to be negative 
according to the twos-complement semantics.
