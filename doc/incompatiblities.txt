Incompatibilities
-----------------

Greatest care has been taken to make the generated code behave exactly 
like the java original. Nevertheless there are some special cases where
this compatibility can not be maintained. All this cases are explicitly 
listed here. Other incompatibilities that are found in the future constitute
a bug in the converter and will either be fixed or also documented here.


- Different default implementation of hashCode()
    Objects not overriding hashCode will provide a default implementation that may deliver
    an extremely weak hash (only depending on the object's class). Do not 
    use these as keys in any Hashtable/HashMap/HashSet. 
    The String and Double objects will create a good hash, but a different one as is specified 
    in java. Do not rely on certain hash values for specific strings.
            
- Different default implementation of toString()
    Objects not overriding toString will provide a default implementation
    that is conversion target specific. Do only use to create a human readable debug output and
    do not rely on any specific format.

- "bad" RuntimeExceptions
    There is a set of runtime situations where the converted code may not behave
    exactly as in java. Specifically these are all occurrences where the java-VM would
    throw any of these exceptions:    
        NullPointerException
        ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        ArrayStoreException
        NegativeArraySizeException
        ClassCastException
        ArithmeticException
    Whenever the program attempts do do such a faulty operation, the behaviour is 
    undefined. It could very well wreck arbitrary data structures and bring the program
    into a situation from which it can not recover.
    The converter already enforces that such exceptions may never be caught, so the
    developer is probably made aware of the problem. Nevertheless testing the original
    java code to see if these exceptions could occur there is strongly recommended.
    
    Other RuntimeExceptions are fine to catch and all library methods should implement
    the exact same functionality in this respect as their java original.
   
- transcendental operations in java.lang.Math
    All conversion targets use the same internal representation of values 
    of type "double" and implement all basic operations according to the standard
    IEEE 754, so the outcome of all computations are bit-perfectly the same.  
    
    Nevertheless there are some transcendental operations in the "java.lang.Math"
    library that could not be exactly replicated. As these operations are by 
    definition impossible to compute exactly, the various libraries use different
    approaches to calculate a near solution, and this leads to slightly different
    results for various conversion targets.   
    Specifically Math.exp and Math.pow show this behaviour even for small numbers.
