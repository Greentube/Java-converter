## Example: Game Of Life 

In this example, the java code provided on
https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Java
was converted.
While the original program directly ran without modifications,
I changed the input data to make the simulation more interesting.
It now contains a blinker and a glider.

Use the provided batch-file to compile the java code (you will have to adjust some paths)
and use "start.html" to launch it in the browser of your choice.
